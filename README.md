# Linear Prediction-based Detection of Serially Concatenated DQPSK in SIMO-OFDM

MATLAB code for the journal:

V. K. Veludandi and K. Vasudevan, “Linear prediction-based detection of serially concatenated DQPSK
in SIMO-OFDM”, Wireless Personal Communications, Springer, vol. 97, issue 3, pp. 4789-4811, 2017.

The MATLAB code for the logBCJR algorithm is inspired by the SCILAB code of BCJR algorithm in the probability-domain written by K Vasudevan and can be found at http://home.iitk.ac.in/~vasu
